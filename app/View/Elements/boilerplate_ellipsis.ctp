    <strong>Text value</strong> for <strong>Reply</strong>-strings only:
    <br/>
    Start or end your string with "..." if you want it to be added to the end or start of the existing
    user input, repsectively. For example <code style="border:1px solid gray;font-size:120%">...&nbsp; Thank you!</code> will add "Thank you!" to the
    end of any text that's already been entered. The three dots must be the very first or last characters
    (anywhere else won't work), and it's best to leave a space as shown.
